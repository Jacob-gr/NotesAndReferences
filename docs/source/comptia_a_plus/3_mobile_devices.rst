- Bluetooth and other standards require separate antennas
- Higher placement is better for antennas
- External antennas can be used to provide better signal pickup

Webcams and Microphones
-----------------------
- Most laptops have both
- External options are available
- Keep security/privacy in mind when managing webcam/microphones

Digitizers
----------
- Samples an analog signal for digital representations (handwriting to digital vectors)
- Used for Touch User Interfaces
- Used in laptops, tablets, art tablets, etc

Power Inverters
----------------
- DC to AC inversion
- Computers require DC
- Some laptop screens require AC
    - Screen inverters convert DC to AC for LCD-CCFL backlights
    - Often located where the screen meets the body

-----------
